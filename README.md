# Google-Cartographer-with-Velodyne16

This repository is for demostrating SLAM using Velodyne 16 Lidar, with Google Cartographer SLAM package in ROS environment.

This Lidar is equiped with 16 channels of laser, thus produces 16 rings of signals at 10 hertz for localization and mapping. 
IMU provides 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis gryoscope, with convariance matrices. 

To use these files on your robot, you could create your own ros package in catkin_ws or simply move these files into corresponding location in the installed Cartographer_ros package. 
Remember to modify the link names of lidar, IMU, base_link and etc. 

If everything is set correctly, using roslaunch to start the sensors and cartographer_launch_file, and RVIZ will automatically open. 


========================================================================

For point cloud, it could be either 2D or 3D.
2D point cloud can only produce 2D SLAM, while 3D point cloud can produce either 2D or 3D SLAM.
If you use some 2D Lidar, like RPLidar, remember to change frame names, and rostopic names.
Velodyne Lidar provides both 3D and 2D point cloud.

According to Google Cartographer webpages, 2D SLAM can run without IMU, but, from my experience, the performance is not good, you could easily lost while moving fast.
